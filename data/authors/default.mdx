I build apps that change the way people see the world. I've built distributed systems, responsive front ends, and intuitive tools. I work with technologies that run on browsers, blockchains, phones, and servers.

I've worked extensively on both the back and front ends of low latency applications, created APIs with a variety of transport protocols, maintained SQL and noSQL databases, and built tools to support, deploy, and monitor everything I put into produciton.

I'm most comfortable writing in Go, JavaScript, and Python, but I will always take the opportunity to learn a new language. I've navigated AWS, DataDog, React, Webpack, Node, Git and much more.

As long as I'm learning, I'm happy.
