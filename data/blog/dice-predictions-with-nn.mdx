This project involves training a neural network to predict the outcome of dice rolls. Two loss
functions are explored for the prediction task: one-hot categorical crossentropy and a custom
distribution-based loss. The neural network is designed using TensorFlow and Keras.

# Why did I make it?

I've always been curious about training Neural Nets, and I wanted to understand the relationship
between a loss function and the accuracy of the network. I originally hypothesized that a loss
function that calculated the aggregate loss across an entire training set would be train faster and
more accurately. It turned out I had a lot of reading to do about the importance of
differentiability of the loss function. Ultimately, a 1 hot encoding of the dice roll and a
crossentropy loss function worked just fine for predicting the probability of rolling numbers on a
dice.
