# What does it do?

`webgocat` is a WebSocket client for the command line. It lets you connect to a WebSocket to send
and receive text messages. Check out the
[single file of code](https://github.com/elliotaplant/webgocat).

# Why?

I love the tool [wscat](https://github.com/websockets/wscat) and have used it for a long time, but I
work on machines that don't have Node/NPM installed. Because `wscat` is installed via NPM and run on
Node, it isn't an option for those projects.

I tried using `websocat`, but the binaries don't come with SSL built in so I couldn't connect to wss
endpoints. One could probably add SSL when compiling from the source, but that seemed onerous.

Go lets you compile a binary for almost any target, so I thought that use Go would be a great tool
to make a WebSocket client without requiring any other dependencies on the host.
