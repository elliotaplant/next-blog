I was messing around with my email settings when I found that you can use Cloudflare to route emails
on any of your domains hosted there. That means that I can set up
[me@elliotplant.com](mailto:me@elliotplant.com) to go directly to my gmail inbox.

And in the same docs where I figured out how to do that, I found that you can
[handle emails with workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/). I've always expected
application flows that _start_ with an inbound email to be really hard to do. Once again, Cloudflare
makes it super easy.

# How do you do it?

Setting up a worker to recieve emails is as simple as:

- Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account and the domain you want to receive
  emails on.
- Go to Email > Email Routing > Email Workers.
- Select "Get started"
- Give it a good name (this isn't necessarily the email address that recieves the email)
- Select any starter. If you want to use the **body** of the email, try this, and note that the
  contents will have a lot more than what appears in your gmail inbox:

```js
export default {
  async email(message, env, ctx) {
    console.log('from', message.from);
    console.log('to', message.to);
    const stringContents = await new Response(message.raw).text();
    console.log('stringContents', stringContents);
  },
};
```

- Hit "Save and deploy"
- Finally, hit "Create route" to add an email address on your domain to trigger the worker.

# This body is useless. Can I just get the body of the email as text?

If you want to interpret your body in a cleaner way, try using a tool like
[MailParser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mailparser). You can get the `text()` or `html()` of the
email pretty simply that way.
