summary:
  'A demonstration of the implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) in a LLM vector
  database. The application manages access to the nodes of the vector database by attaching an
  allowlist of roles to the metadata of each node. This enables nodes to have an unlimited number of
  allowed roles. If the application were extended to use "real" data sources, those roles could be
  sourced from the data source API, such as the Google Drive API.'

A demonstration of the implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) in a LLM vector database.
The application manages access to the nodes of the vector database by attaching an allowlist of
roles to the metadata of each node. This enables nodes to have an unlimited number of allowed roles.
If the application were extended to use "real" data sources, those roles could be sourced from the
data source API, such as the Google Drive API.

# Why did I make it?

This project was for an interview with a very interesting AI security company. I enjoyed navigating
the novel difficulties of LLMs and security.
