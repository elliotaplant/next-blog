# Doodle Clone

I built a scheduling poll application inspired by Doodle using Cloudflare Workers. You can try it out at [doodle.elliotplant.com](https://doodle.elliotplant.com) or check out the [source code](https://github.com/elliotaplant/doodle).

# Why did I build this?

Coordinating meetings with multiple people is always a pain. You either send around a bunch of "what about Tuesday?" messages or create a complex spreadsheet that nobody wants to fill out. Doodle solved this problem elegantly, but I wanted to understand how to build something similar and experiment with Cloudflare Workers' capabilities.

# What does it do?

The app lets you create scheduling polls with multiple date and time options using an interactive calendar. Participants can then vote Yes/Maybe/No for each time slot, and you get real-time results showing vote counts and participant names.

Key features include:
- Interactive poll creation with calendar interface
- Simple Yes/Maybe/No voting for each time slot
- Real-time results showing all votes
- Clean responsive UI that works on desktop and mobile
- No database required - uses Cloudflare Workers with in-memory storage

# How did I build it?

The entire application runs on Cloudflare Workers using a modern tech stack:

- **Hono** - Lightweight web framework for the API
- **chanfana** - OpenAPI 3.1 integration for automatic API documentation
- **Zod** - Schema validation for type safety
- **TypeScript** - End-to-end type safety

The architecture is surprisingly simple. Poll data is stored in Cloudflare's key-value storage, and the UI is server-rendered HTML with vanilla JavaScript for interactivity. No complex frontend framework needed.

# What's next?

This was a great experiment in building with Cloudflare Workers. The serverless model makes deployment incredibly simple, and the global edge network means the app is fast anywhere in the world.

I might add features like email notifications when polls are created or voted on, or integration with calendar applications to automatically schedule the winning time slot.
