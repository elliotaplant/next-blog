RaspiWiFi is a program to headlessly configure a Raspberry Pi's WiFi connection using using any
other WiFi-enabled device, much like the way a Chromecast or or smart speaker.
[Check out the code](https://github.com/elliotaplant/RaspiWiFi).

# Why did I make it?

When building my surf posters, I knew I would need a way for eventual buyers to be able to set up
the WiFi on their posters by themselves. I started by hard-coding the WiFI credentials into the
Raspberry Pi's memory card, but that stopped working as soon as a friend I had given one to decided
to move.

I wanted a smooth login experience, and I found that [jasbur](https://github.com/jasbur/RaspiWiFi)
had made something that was _almost_ exactly what I was looking for. I wanted to change the style on
the HTML configuration page, so I forked the repo and adjusted the code.
