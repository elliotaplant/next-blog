Amber and I made a Spanish vocab game with the help of ChatGPT.

# How to play

To play, print [the cards](https://blog.docsite.io/projects/spanish-vocab-game.html) and place them
face down. The first player picks up a card and then has 2 minutes to get the group to guess as many
of the words on their card by describing them (in Spanish) without saying any of those words.

# Want more?

If you want more categories and cards, ask ChatGPT. It was clever enough to think of new categories
for us and find words in those categories
