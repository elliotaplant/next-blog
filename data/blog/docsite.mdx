DocSite is a tool I built that turns Google Docs or Google Drive folders into web pages and web
sites.

# Why did I make it?

I have a friend who writes a lot, but only likes to write in MS Word. No twitter, no markdown, no
blogging platforms. DocSite was an attempt to make it easy for him to host a website of his own
instead of email his friends `.docx` files.

# How does it work?

Once you've created an account and granted DocSite access to your Google Drive, you can select any
file or folder you'd like to turn into a website. DocSite's servers (currently hosted on
Cloudflare):

- Download your doc as HTML
- Extracts images to store in a file bucket
- Add a bit of code to make the HTML mobile friendly
- Edit the links to remove Google's tracking parameters
- Stores the modified HTML to a static file bucket on cloudflare.

If you select a Drive folder instead of a Doc, then the servers recursively navigate through your
folder tree and publish all of the docs nested in that folder.

# How did I get custom subdomain DNS working?

Cloudflare has a cool DNS feature that let's you
[host wildcard DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/wildcard-dns-records/).
This let me utilize the subdomain at request time to serve the appropriate HTML file.

# Want to try it?

I would love if someone else tried it. I think DocSite is really cool, and I'm eager to help someone
get online with it.
