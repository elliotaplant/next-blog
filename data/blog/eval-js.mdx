eval-js is a simple VS Code plugin that evaluates highlighted code as JavaScript. It's very useful
for wrangling large-ish files of text where you need to do a little bit of math or a little bit of
string munging.

# Why did you make it?

I loved Atom and it's multi-cursor support. There was a JS Eval extension for Atom (I may have
written it?) that let you evaluate highlighted text as JS on multiple cursors. There wasn't a
similar plugin for VS Code, so when Atom was sunset, I made this for myself.
