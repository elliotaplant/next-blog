AI Scavenger Hunt is a simple OpenAI enabled app that helps parents make silly scavenger hunts for
their kids. I first saw this idea in an Instagram post, and I immediately knew I wanted to make an
app with it. [Try it out now](https://scavenger-hunt.elliotplant.com/) or
[check out the code](https://github.com/elliotaplant/scavenger-hunt).

If you've used it, please let me know! I'd love to hear that this tool brought some joy to your
life.

# How did you get such amazing styles?

This was the first project I used [mvp.css](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/), and I loved it. It's
a wonderful way for someone like me who _cares_ about design but _isn't good_ at design to make
something that doesn't look terrible. I highly recommend it to anyone who makes websites or web
apps.
