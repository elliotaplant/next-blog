# Run JavaScript

A VS Code extension to run custom JavaScript files as commands in VS Code.
[Try it out](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ElliotPlant.run-javascript) or
[check out the code](https://github.com/elliotaplant/run-javascript).

# Why did you make it?

I loved Atom and it's configurability, but Atom was sunsetted a while ago. Atom had a unique feature
where you could write JS files in your atom config and the exports of those files were available in
the editor context. You could bind hotkeys to do any scripting you wanted in your editor.

So when I found that you couldn't do that in VS Code, I made this tool to help run arbitrary JS
files with a hotkey.
