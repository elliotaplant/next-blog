A VS Code extension to make code folding in VS Code similar to code folding in Atom
[Try it out](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ElliotPlant.fold-at-levels) or
[check out the code](https://github.com/elliotaplant/fold-at-levels).

# Why did you make it?

I loved Atom, and Atom tought me most of what I know about text editors. When Atom was sunsetted a
while ago, I wanted to carry over my code-folding abilities into VS Code. Unfortunately, VS Code
doesn't have the same ability to fold all of the lines to a single level. So I made this extension
so I could do that.
