PDF to Text is a browser-based tool that extracts and views the text content from PDF files easily
and quickly. Designed to be simple, efficient, and work inside your browser. No need to upload files
to external servers or install additional software. It's great for copying text from PDFs into
chatbots. [Try it now](https://pdf-to-text.elliotplant.com/) or

# Why did you make it?

I use ChatGPT a lot. And I intereact with PDFs a lot. Often, PDFs aren't easy to copy-paste text
from. If the text layer is available, most of the time it isn't formatted the same way it would be
written on a normal `.txt` file. I wanted a way to quickly extract text from a PDF with a text layer
into a text file that preserved the layout so it would be comprehensible by a chatbot.
