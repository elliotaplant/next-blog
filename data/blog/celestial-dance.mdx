Edit (June 6, 2016): In light of the recent passing of Dr. Klug at UCLA, this project is a
dedication to him, his amazing work as a teacher, and the family he talked about so frequently and
loved so clearly. Dr. Klug taught me dynamics, engineering programming, and finite element analysis,
all of which were utilized in this project and essential to my development as an engineer. I
couldn't have asked for a better professor, and my heart goes out to friends and family he leaves
behind.

# Orbital Mechanics Simulation

Celestial Dancers is an orbital mechanics simulation I made using React and A-Frame VR. The
simulation is built for virtual reality browsers, so it's best viewed with google cardboard and a
smart phone. It still works on desktop, and with the keyboard you can fly through space and use your
mouse to look around. [Try it live](https://elliotplant.com/celestial-dance/) or
[take a look at the code](https://github.com/elliotaplant/celestial-dance).

I built the physics engine for this project entirely in JavaScript. The engine incorporates
gravitational forces and collisions with custom React components, and updates itself with A-Frame's
component lifecycle events.

I maintained the interactions between each pair of bodies, adding new interactions as new bodies
entered the scene. On every cycle, each interaction would calculate the distance between its two
bodies, use Newton's law of universal gravitation to calculate a gravity force, and use Hooke's law
to calculate a collision force. Roughly 10 times per second, the sum of the collision and gravity
forces would update the acceleration, velocity, and finally position of each body.

# Challenges

I ran into an interesting technical challenge related to the update cycle of the simulation and the
order of the force calculation and position update. When I first built the simulation, I iterated
over each body to calculate its interaction with each other body, and then I would move it
accordingly before beginning the calculations for the next body. My process looked like:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
on each update cycle of the simulation
   for each body in the simulation
      calculate the forces due to all the other bodies in the simulation
      sum those forces
      update the current body's acceleration from that sum
      update the current body's velocity from that acceleration
      update the current body's position from that velocity
   end
end
```

I realized that because I updated the position of body A before calculating the forces on body B,
the force from A to B would be slightly different than the force from B to A. This worked just fine
when bodies were far apart, but if they got too close to one another, their interactions became
erratic. Bodies would approach one another and then rapidly fly off into the distance.

To solve this problem, I rearranged the calculation and update steps so that all of the forces were
calculated before any of the positions were updated:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
on each update cycle of the simulation
   for each interaction in the simulation
      calculate the force between the interaction's two bodies
   end
   for each interaction in the simulation
      update the simulation's bodies' accelerations
      update the simulation's bodies' velocities from those accelerations
      update the simulation's bodies' positions from those velocities
   end
end
```

This update pattern solved the problem perfectly because all of the forces for a given update cycle
were calculated using the same state.
